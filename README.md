# Spirits

Spirits is a plugin meant for roleplay wherein dead players become semi-transparent ghosts.

Commands:

    /spirits help -- Lists the Spirits commands
    /spirits setlives <player> <amount> -- Sets <player>'s non-canon life count to <amount>
    /spirits revive [player] -- Makes <player> no longer a spirit
    /spirits kill [player] -- Makes <player> a spirit
    /spirits hardcore [player] -- Toggles "hardcore", setting their lives to 1 (useful for RP)
